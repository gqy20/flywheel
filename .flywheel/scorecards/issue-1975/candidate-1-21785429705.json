    "test_coverage": "Added regression test test_save_calls_fsync_for_durability that verifies os.fsync is called for data durability. All 7 atomicity tests pass.",
    "minimal_fix": "Minimal change - added f.flush() and os.fsync() calls before atomic rename. No refactoring or additional changes.",
    "correctness": "fsync is correctly called on the file descriptor after writing content and before atomic rename, ensuring data is written to disk.",
    "documentation": "Updated docstring of save() method to mention fsync. Added detailed docstring to new test explaining the purpose.",
    "security": "fsync addition strengthens data durability without introducing security issues. Uses file.fileno() for proper fd access."
