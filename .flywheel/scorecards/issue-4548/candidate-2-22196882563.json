  "implementation_notes": [
    "Changed from implicit `str(data.get('x') or '')` pattern to explicit None handling",
    "When created_at/updated_at is None, it's converted to empty string which triggers __post_init__",
    "Added 6 regression tests documenting the expected behavior for timestamp handling"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Behavior is preserved - None still triggers new timestamp generation via __post_init__",
    "This is a code clarity fix, not a behavior change"
  ]
}
