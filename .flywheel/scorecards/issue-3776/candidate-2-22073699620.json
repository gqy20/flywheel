  "risks": "This issue was identified as a false positive. Python's !r format specifier already handles control character escaping correctly. The tests added serve as regression tests to document and ensure this behavior continues.",
  "implementation_notes": "The issue suggested applying similar sanitization as formatter._sanitize_text() for control characters in __repr__ output. However, investigation revealed that Python's !r (repr) conversion already properly escapes all control characters including null bytes (\\x00), ANSI escape sequences (\\x1b), carriage returns (\\r), tabs (\\t), DEL characters (\\x7f), and C1 control characters (0x80-0x9f). The added tests verify this existing behavior."
