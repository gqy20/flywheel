  "summary": "Added validation in Todo.from_dict to ensure 'id' must be a positive integer (>= 1). The fix raises ValueError with a clear message when id is 0 or negative.",

  "tests_passed": 115,
  "approach": "TDD - added failing tests first, then implemented minimal fix with validation after int conversion",
  "risks": "None - the fix is minimal and only affects Todo.from_dict validation. The only side effect was fixing a pre-existing bug in test_storage_atomicity.py where ids were incorrectly using 0."
