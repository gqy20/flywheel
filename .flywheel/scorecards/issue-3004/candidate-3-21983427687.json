  "summary": "Fix boolean id acceptance in Todo.from_dict by adding explicit type check before int() conversion",
  "approach": "Added isinstance(data['id'], bool) check before the int() conversion to explicitly reject boolean values, which are silently converted to 0/1 in Python since bool is a subclass of int.",
  "risks": "None. The fix is minimal and only affects the validation logic. It adds stricter type checking which is the intended behavior.",
