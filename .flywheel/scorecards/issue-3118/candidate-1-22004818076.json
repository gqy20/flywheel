  "implementation_summary": "Added validation in Todo.__post_init__ to ensure id is a positive integer (id > 0). This validates both direct Todo construction and Todo.from_dict() since both paths go through __post_init__.",
  "risks": "Minimal - the validation only rejects invalid data that should never have been accepted. Fixed existing tests that were using id=0 inadvertently."
