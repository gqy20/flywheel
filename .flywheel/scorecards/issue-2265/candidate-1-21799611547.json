    "issue_summary": "Enhancement request to add file backup before overwrite in TodoStorage.save() method",
    "root_cause": "The save() method at src/flywheel/storage.py:85 uses atomic os.replace to directly overwrite the target file without creating any backup copy. If data corruption occurs or incorrect data is written, there is no recovery mechanism.",
    "risk_points": [
      "No backup mechanism exists - if save() succeeds with incorrect data, original data is permanently lost",
      "Backup operations could fail and should not prevent the main save operation",
      "Need to control backup file count to avoid disk space issues"
    ],
    "verification_targets": [
      "Add test verifying .backup file is created when enable_backup=True",
      "Add test verifying max_backups parameter controls number of retained backups",
      "Add test verifying backup failure does not prevent main save operation",
      "Add test verifying backup rotation removes oldest backups when limit exceeded"
    ],
    "implementation_plan": [
      "Add enable_backup and max_backups parameters to TodoStorage.__init__()",
      "Create _create_backup() helper method to copy existing file to .backup suffix",
      "Create _rotate_backups() helper method to enforce max_backups limit",
      "Modify save() to call backup methods before atomic overwrite",
      "Ensure backup failures are caught and suppressed with contextlib.suppress()"
