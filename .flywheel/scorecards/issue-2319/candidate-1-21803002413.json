  "implementation_summary": "Added automatic backup creation before saving with rotation to keep 3 most recent backups. Backup creation failure does not prevent save operation.",
  "risks": [
    "Backup files are created in the same directory as the main file, which may use additional disk space",
    "Backup rotation uses file renaming which could fail on some filesystems, but failures are silently ignored"
  ]
