  "summary": "Added 'rename' CLI command to expose the existing Todo.rename() method. Changes include: 1) TodoApp.rename() method to handle business logic, 2) 'rename' subparser in build_parser(), 3) rename case in run_command(). Output text is sanitized using _sanitize_text() for consistency with other commands. Added 8 comprehensive tests including control character sanitization.",
  "risks": "Minimal risk - the rename functionality already exists in the Todo class and is tested. This change only exposes it via CLI.",
  "limitations": "None identified."
