  },
  "risks": [
    "Using unsafe_hash=True means that mutable Todo objects can be used in sets/dicts. If a Todo is mutated after being added to a set, its hash won't update automatically, which could lead to unexpected behavior. This is acceptable because: 1) The issue explicitly requests hashability for testing purposes, 2) The existing code already has mutability via mark_done(), mark_undone(), rename() methods, 3) This is the minimal fix without breaking existing functionality."
  ],
  "alternatives_considered": [
    "frozen=True dataclass - rejected because it would break existing mutability methods (mark_done, mark_undone, rename)",
    "Custom __eq__ and __hash__ methods - rejected because dataclass auto-generated __eq__ already works correctly"
  ],
  "met_acceptance_criteria": [
    "Two Todo objects with same id, text, done, created_at, updated_at are considered equal - YES (via dataclass auto-__eq__)",
    "Todo objects can be used in sets and as dict keys - YES (via unsafe_hash=True)",
    "Tests can use assert todo1 == todo2 instead of comparing individual fields - YES"
  ]
