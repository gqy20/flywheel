  "summary": "Refactor TodoApp.remove() to use explicit iteration pattern",
  "description": "Changed remove() method from list comprehension with length comparison to explicit iteration with enumerate() and pop(), matching the pattern used by mark_done() and mark_undone() methods.",

  "ruff_check": "passed",
  "risks": [
    "The change is minimal and focused on the remove() method only.",
    "The new implementation follows the same pattern as mark_done() and mark_undone(), which are well-tested.",
    "All existing tests pass, including new regression tests specifically for this issue."
  ],
  "limitations": [],
  "acceptance_criteria_met": [
    "remove() method uses explicit iteration pattern consistent with mark_done()/mark_undone()",
    "Behavior is identical for valid inputs",
    "Error handling is consistent across all todo modification methods",
    "All tests pass (5 new tests for this issue, 107 total)"
