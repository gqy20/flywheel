  "risks": [
    "Backup files are created in the same directory as the main file, which could fail if the directory is read-only",
    "Backup rotation uses simple file renaming which could theoretically fail in rare filesystem race conditions (mitigated by graceful degradation)",
    "Large JSON files (approaching 10MB limit) will create equally large backup files, consuming disk space"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "Backup retention is fixed at runtime initialization, cannot be changed without creating new TodoStorage instance",
    "No automatic cleanup of old backup files from previous runs (only manages backups created during current session)",
    "Backup files are not compressed or compressed differently from main file",
    "No timestamp in backup filenames - rotation order is implicit"
  ]
