  "issue_number": 1908,
  "candidate_id": "1-21781413580",
  "title": "[Security] Path traversal: no validation on storage path, allowing writes outside intended",
  "approach": "Block parent directory traversal by rejecting paths containing '..' segments",
  "files_changed": [
    "src/flywheel/storage.py",
    "tests/test_minimal_framework.py"

  "risks": [
    "Does not restrict absolute paths - users can still write to any absolute path if they have permissions"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "The fix blocks '..' traversal patterns but allows absolute paths (e.g., /tmp/file.json)",
    "This is intentional to allow legitimate use cases while blocking path traversal attacks"
  ],
