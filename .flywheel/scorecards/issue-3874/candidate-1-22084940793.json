  "summary": "Added comprehensive documentation to TodoStorage class warning users about last-writer-wins semantics and potential data loss in multi-process scenarios. Added regression test to verify documentation exists.",
  "risks": [
    "This is a documentation-only fix - actual data loss risk still exists in multi-process scenarios",
    "Users must read the documentation to be aware of the limitation"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "No actual file locking or conflict detection implemented",
    "For production multi-process use, external locking or database solution still recommended"
  ]
}
