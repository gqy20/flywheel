  "created_at": "2026-02-13T00:00:00Z",
  "status": "implemented",
  "fix_summary": {
    "problem": "os.fchmod can fail silently on some filesystems (FAT32, network mounts) or when fd is invalidated, causing save() to crash",
    "solution": "Added try/except wrapper around os.fchmod with fallback to os.chmod(temp_path) after file write. If both fail, logs a warning but continues with the save operation.",

  "acceptance_criteria_met": [
    "On filesystems that don't support permissions (FAT32), save() should not crash",
    "Warning should be logged if permissions cannot be set to 0o600",
    "Normal Unix filesystems should still get 0o600 permissions"
  ],
  "risks_and_limitations": [
    "On non-permission-supporting filesystems, the file may have default permissions rather than 0o600",
    "This is acceptable as the save operation is more critical than permission enforcement"
