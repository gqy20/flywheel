  "implementation_notes": [
    "Added CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION constant (currently set to 1)",

  "limitations": [
    "No automatic migration from old format to new format",
    "No migration registry implemented (was listed as optional in issue)",

  "acceptance_criteria_met": [
    "Stored JSON files include a '_version' key with current schema version",
    "TodoStorage.load() raises clear error when version mismatch is detected",
    "A migration registry placeholder exists (validation logic in place)",
    "Existing tests pass and new version validation tests are added"
  ]
