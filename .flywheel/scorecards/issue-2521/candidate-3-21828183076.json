  "implementation_summary": "Added schema version validation and migration support to TodoStorage class. JSON files now include a '_version' field and 'todos' key. Clear error messages are raised for missing or incompatible versions. Migration registry is in place for future schema changes.",
  "risks_and_limitations": [
    "This change modifies the JSON file format from a plain list to an object with '_version' and 'todos' keys. Existing users with old-format files will receive an error message prompting them to reinitialize or migrate their data.",
    "No automatic migration from old list format to new dict format is implemented - users will need to manually handle old data files or we can add a migration in a follow-up."
