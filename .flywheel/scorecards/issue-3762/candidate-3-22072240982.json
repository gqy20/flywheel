  "scorecard": {
    "root_cause_analysis": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Identified that Todo.from_dict allows creating Todos with duplicate ids, and storage.load() did not validate uniqueness. This breaks next_id() which assumes max+1 uniqueness and mark_done/remove which match on first occurrence."
    },
    "test_coverage": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Added 4 new tests covering: rejection of duplicate ids, acceptance of unique ids, rejection of multiple duplicates, and validation of next_id consistency after valid load."
    },
    "minimal_change": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Minimal fix added only 12 lines of validation logic in storage.load() to check for duplicate ids after parsing todos. No changes to existing interfaces or data structures."
    },
    "backward_compatibility": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Fix is backward compatible. Existing valid data (with unique ids) loads normally. Only corrupt data with duplicate ids is rejected with a clear error message."
    },
    "error_handling": {
      "score": 5,
      "justification": "Clear error message includes which id(s) are duplicated: 'Duplicate todo id(s) found in storage: 1, 2. Each todo must have a unique id.'"
