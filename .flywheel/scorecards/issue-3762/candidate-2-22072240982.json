  "summary": "Added validation in TodoStorage.load() to detect and reject duplicate IDs in the JSON storage file. This ensures data integrity by preventing silent corruption that could occur when next_id() generates IDs based on max+1 assumption.",
  "risks": [
    "External JSON files with duplicate IDs will now fail to load (breaking change for corrupt data)",
    "Small performance overhead for tracking seen IDs during load"
  ],
  "mitigation": [
    "Clear error message indicates which IDs are duplicated",
    "Performance overhead is minimal (O(n) set operations)"
  ]
}
