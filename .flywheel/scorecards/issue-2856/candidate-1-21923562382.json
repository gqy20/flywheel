  "title": "Document Todo.from_dict None handling is correct",
  "problem_summary": "Issue #2856 claimed that str(data.get('created_at') or '') with None returns 'None' string. This was based on a misunderstanding of Python operator precedence. The current code is CORRECT because 'or' has LOWER precedence than function call, so str(None or '') = str('') = '', not str(None) or '' = 'None' or '' = 'None'.",
  "resolution": "NO_FIX_NEEDED - The current code already handles None correctly. The issue reporter was confused about Python operator precedence.",
