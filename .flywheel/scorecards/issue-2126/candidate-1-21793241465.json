  "triage_summary": "Root cause: from_dict() uses str() to coerce timestamp fields without type validation, accepting int/list/dict which become meaningless strings. Risk: data integrity and security issues with invalid timestamp data in storage.",

    "created_at as list raises ValueError",

  "implementation_summary": "Added type validation for timestamp fields in from_dict(). Fields must be string or None/missing. Invalid types (int, list, dict) now raise ValueError with clear message. 9 new regression tests added.",
