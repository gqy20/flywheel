  "summary": "Fixed TOCTOU symlink vulnerability in load() by using lstat() instead of stat() to avoid following symlinks. Added symlink detection and rejection with clear security error messages.",
  "approach": "Use Path.lstat() instead of Path.stat() to check file info without following symlinks, then reject symlinks explicitly with a clear error message.",
  "risks": "None - this is a pure security hardening change that rejects symlinks which should not be used for todo storage anyway.",
  "limitations": "Users cannot use symlinks for todo.json files anymore. This is intentional for security."
}
