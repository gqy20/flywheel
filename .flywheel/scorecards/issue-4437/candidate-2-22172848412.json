  "summary": "Add validation in Todo.from_dict to reject negative or zero IDs",
  "tests_added": 3,

  ],
  "approach": "Added validation check `if todo_id <= 0` after the int conversion to raise ValueError with clear message for non-positive IDs. Also fixed test_storage_atomicity.py which was using id=0 in concurrent test.",
  "risks": "Minimal - only adds validation, no behavior change for valid positive IDs",
