  "summary": "Fix path traversal vulnerability by validating paths for '../' sequences at TodoStorage construction time.",
  "approach": "Add _validate_path_safety() function that checks for '..' path components in both forward-slash and backslash variants. The validation happens at construction time to fail fast on malicious input.",

  "risks": [
    "Users legitimately using '..' in paths (e.g., 'data/backup..json') will be blocked - this is considered acceptable as such patterns are unusual",
    "Symlink-based traversal is not addressed by this fix - existing symlink protection in the codebase handles that"
