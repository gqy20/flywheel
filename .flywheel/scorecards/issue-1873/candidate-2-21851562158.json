  "summary": "Added path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks via '../' sequences. The fix adds a _validate_path_safe function that checks for '../' patterns in relative paths and validates they don't escape the base directory. Absolute paths remain allowed as they are explicitly chosen by the user.",
  "risks": [
    "Absolute paths outside working directory are still allowed - this is intentional as they are user-specified",
    "The fix uses string pattern matching for '../' which could theoretically be bypassed with URL encoding, but this is a CLI tool so that risk is minimal"
  ],
  "limitations": "Path validation is based on string patterns ('../' and '..\\\\'). For a web application, more robust validation using os.path.normpath would be needed."
