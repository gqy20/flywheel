  "fix_summary": {
    "problem": "from_dict accepts non-string values (dict, list, int, float) for created_at/updated_at fields, using str() coercion which can produce unexpected values like 'dict' or '[1, 2, 3]'",
    "solution": "Added explicit type validation for created_at and updated_at fields, accepting only str or None types, rejecting dict, list, int, float, and other incompatible types",
    "files_changed": ["src/flywheel/todo.py"],
    "lines_changed": 25
  },
  "risks": [
    "Existing data with integer timestamps (e.g., Unix timestamps stored as numbers) will now be rejected - should be stored as strings instead",
    "Behavior change: previously str() coercion would convert anything to string, now strict validation may break edge cases"
