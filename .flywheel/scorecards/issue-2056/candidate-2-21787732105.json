  "notes": "Issue #2056 is already fixed in the codebase. The DEL character (0x7f) is properly escaped in _sanitize_text() function at line 29 of formatter.py using the condition '0x7f <= code <= 0x9f'. This was originally fixed in PR #2028 (commit 77ad8bd) and later enhanced in PR #2057 (commit a497564) to also cover C1 control characters."
