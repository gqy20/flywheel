  "status": "implemented",
  "stage": "IMPLEMENT",
  "summary": "Fixed race condition in next_id() causing ID collisions in concurrent add operations by adding file-based locking using flock(2).",

    "source_files": [
      "src/flywheel/storage.py",

  "tests_added": 4,
  "implementation_details": {
    "approach": "Added a lock() context manager to TodoStorage that uses fcntl.flock for inter-process locking. Modified TodoApp.add() to use this lock when performing read-modify-write operations.",
    "key_changes": [
      "Added fcntl import and contextmanager decorator to storage.py",
      "Added lock() method to TodoStorage class using flock(LOCK_EX) for exclusive locking",
      "Modified TodoApp.add() to wrap load/next_id/save in lock context",
      "Created comprehensive test suite for concurrent add operations"
    ]
  },
  "risks": [
    "File locking is Unix-specific (fcntl). This won't work on Windows.",
    "Lock file (.json.lock) may remain if process crashes during lock, but flock automatically releases when fd closes."
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "Only addresses the add() operation. Other operations (mark_done, mark_undone, remove) may still have race conditions if used concurrently.",
    "Lock file is stored alongside the database file, which may require cleanup in some scenarios."
  ]
