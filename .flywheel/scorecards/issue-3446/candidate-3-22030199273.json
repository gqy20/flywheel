  "branch": "claude/issue-3446-candidate-3-22030199273",
  "status": "implemented",
  "summary": "Added JSON nesting depth validation to prevent stack overflow attacks from deeply nested JSON structures",
  "changes": {
    "source_files": [
      "src/flywheel/storage.py"
    ],
    "test_files": [
      "tests/test_minimal_framework.py"
    ]
  },
  "implementation_details": {
    "approach": "Added recursive depth check function `_check_json_depth()` that validates parsed JSON structures don't exceed 512 levels of nesting",
    "max_depth_limit": 512,
    "rationale": "512 levels is generous for normal business data but prevents malicious deeply-nested JSON that could cause stack overflow"
  },
  "tests_passed": [
    "test_storage_load_rejects_deeply_nested_json",
    "test_storage_load_accepts_normal_nesting_depth",
    "All 12 tests in test_minimal_framework.py",
    "All 6 tests in test_storage_atomicity.py"
  ],
  "linting": "ruff check passed",
  "risks": [
    "Deep nesting check runs after JSON parsing, so extremely deep structures could still cause issues during parsing itself. However, Python's json module has built-in recursion limits that provide some protection."
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "The depth check occurs post-parsing, meaning the memory is already allocated. This is acceptable because file size is limited to 10MB."
  ]
