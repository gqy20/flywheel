  "risks": [
    "The list() method was renamed to list_todos(), which is a breaking change for any external consumers of this API. However, the TodoApp class appears to be internal to this project."
  ],
  "verification_steps": [
    "All call sites of app.list() were updated to app.list_todos() in cli.py and test files",
    "New regression test file added to verify list_todos() works correctly",
