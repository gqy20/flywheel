  "summary": "Fixed next_id() inconsistency by removing redundant conditional check. The max() function with default=0 already handles empty list case correctly, returning 1 when empty. Added comprehensive test coverage for edge cases including non-contiguous IDs.",

  "implementation_notes": [
    "Simplified next_id() by removing redundant 'if todos else 1' check",
    "max() with default=0 returns 0 for empty list, so 0+1=1 is correct",
    "Added docstring to clarify ID generation behavior (monotonically increasing, never reused)",
    "Added comprehensive regression tests for non-contiguous IDs and edge cases"
  ],
  "risks": "Low - simplification of existing logic with same behavior",
  "limitations": "None"
}
